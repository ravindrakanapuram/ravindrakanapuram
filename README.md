> *"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." — Cory House*  

Hi there! 👋 I’m **[Your Name]**, a passionate developer, tech enthusiast, and part-time meme collector. 😂  
I enjoy creating meaningful projects, automating boring tasks, and occasionally convincing people that **dark mode** is the superior mode. 🌑

## 🎭 Who Am I?  

- 🤓 A code geek on weekdays, a Netflix binger on weekends.  
- 🦸 Part-time bug fixer, full-time feature breaker.  
- 🌟 Fun fact: I once Googled "how to exit Vim" and became a Stack Overflow guru overnight. 🙈  

### 🎯 2025 Goals:  
- 🚀 Build an app that *actually* does something useful.  
- 🤖 Teach my cat how to code (results TBD 🐈‍⬛).  
- 🏆 Become the world's top bug fixer (if bugs stop multiplying!).
